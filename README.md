# TaskManagerCLI

A modern, feature-rich command-line application for managing projects and tasks with clarity, efficiency, and structure.

---

## Overview

**TaskManagerCLI** is a clean, object-oriented Java application designed to help developers and productivity-focused users organize projects, track tasks, and manage deadlines directly from the terminal. The tool provides persistent data storage, a color-coded interface, and a smooth, menu-driven workflow.

This CLI utility is ideal for users who prefer speed, simplicity, and terminal-based productivity.

## Features

### Project Management

* Create, update, delete, and view projects.
* Each project maintains its own set of tasks.
* Automatic project ID generation.

### Task Management

* Add, edit, delete, or update tasks.
* Supports attributes including:

  * Title
  * Description
  * Priority (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `URGENT`)
  * Status (`PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`)
  * Due Date

### Deadline Tracking

* Background thread continuously monitors approaching and overdue deadlines.
* Alerts for:

  * Tasks due today
  * Tasks due tomorrow
  * Overdue tasks
* Manual deadline check available from the menu.

### Persistent Storage

* Automatic reading and writing using Java serialization.
* Data stored in the `data/` directory.

### Terminal Interface

* Color-coded output for better readability:

  * Green for completed
  * Yellow for in-progress
  * Red for overdue
  * White for pending
* Clean and structured menu-driven navigation.

## Installation & Running the Application

### **Method 1: Run Manually (Without Docker)**

### Requirements

* Java 17 or later
* A terminal or command prompt

### Steps

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TaskManagerCLI.git
cd TaskManagerCLI
```

#### Compile the Source Code

```bash
javac -d out src/com/taskmanager/**/*.java
```

#### Run the Application (Manual Method)

```bash
java -cp out com.taskmanager.Main
```

---

### **Method 2: Run Using Docker (Recommended for Data Persistence)**

#### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t taskmanager-cli .
```

#### Run with Volume Mount (so your data is never lost)

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  taskmanager-cli
```

This command ensures that all saved tasks and projects inside the container are written to your **local `data/` folder**, preventing data loss.

---

#### Run the Application

```bash
java -cp out com.taskmanager.Main
```

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object-Oriented Programming** | Organized structure using classes for projects, tasks, and services |
| **Serialization**               | Automatic data saving and loading                                   |
| **Exception Handling**          | Custom exceptions for validation and file operations                |
